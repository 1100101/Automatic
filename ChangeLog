2009-12-05 v0.4.4
      Fixed: Segfault when a regular expression within the "patterns" option was missing the closing
             double-quote
      Fixed: Raised the maximum size for a parameter (necessary if you have many (long) patterns)


2009-11-23 v0.4.3
			Fixed: Properly strip HTTP header lines
			Fixed: Only acquire Transmission RPC version if Transmission is to be used
			Fixed: Only check Prowl API key if there actually is a key available
			Added: The above changes make Automatic work with NZB feeds as well (yay!)

2009-10-29 v0.4.2
            Added: Prowl notification support
            Fixed: URLs with semicolons were wrongly parsed
          Changed: Reconfigured libcurl a little to deal with infinite timeouts
            Added: External script support. You can now specify an external script that
                   gets fired whenever Automatic finds a match in the RSS feeds
                   (Contributed by Oolan Zimmer, thank you very much!)

2009-05-14 v0.4
            Added: New option "upload-limit" in automatic.conf. Set to a value in KB/s, Automatic
                   will limit the upload speed for each new torrent to this value.
            Added: New commandline option "-o/--once": Quit Automatic after checking RSS feeds once.
                   Use this if you want to use Automatic in conjunction with crontab.
            Fixed: Compatibility issue with Transmission 1.53+ and 1.61+ (CSRF protection)

            Fixed: Possible memory leak in get_tr_folder() and get_temp_folder()

            Fixed: Problems with download history if Automatic downloaded many torrents at once
            Added: New option "start-torrents" in automatic.conf. If set to "yes", torrents will start
                   to download automatically when added to Transmission (default behavior)
                   If set to "no", they'll be added in a "Paused" state

            Fixed: Automatic didn't follow redirects (Code 302) when downloading files

2008-11-29 v0.3
