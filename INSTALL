Installation instructions
--------------------------

1. Dependencies
----------------

Automatic makes use of the libcurl and libxml2 libraries, so make sure those are installed.
You'll also need automake to run autgen.sh - on Debian-derived distros, `apt-get install automake`.

2. Configuration
----------------

First autogenerate the configuration files by typing

        ./autogen.sh

then configure the tool by typing

        ./configure

This should work on most systems and prepare the package for compilation. You may check out further
options by typing ./configure --help

After configure is done, you compile via

        make

If everything went well, install Automatic by typing

        make install

That's it! You're done!

Start Automatic with the command 'automatic'. You may specify a different location for the configuration file
(the default one sits at /etc/automatic.conf)


Have fun!
