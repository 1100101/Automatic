Automatic is a RSS daemon that downloads torrent files matching given regular expression patterns
at given intervals.

It is capable of adding downloaded torrents directly to Transmission (www.transmissionbt.com), making
it a auto-downloader.

The user has to place a configuration file automatic.conf in the /usr/etc folder.
The file contains further instructions on how to configure the tool.
