Automatic - RSS downloader for Tranmission
===========================================

Automatic is a RSS daemon that downloads torrent files matching regular expression patterns
at certain intervals.

It is capable of adding downloaded torrents directly to Transmission (www.transmissionbt.com), making
it a auto-downloader.

Automatic is configured via a configuration file (by default placed at /etc/automatic.conf)

The file contains further instructions on how to configure the tool.
